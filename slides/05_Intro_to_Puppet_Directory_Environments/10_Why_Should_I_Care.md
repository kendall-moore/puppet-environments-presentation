## Why Environments are Important

* Easily manage separate modules and profiles all on the same Puppet Master
* Vendor patches that remove all of your LDAP databases no longer happen in production at 3 in the morning (Thanks, RedHat)
* Directory environments provide seamless integration with source control
* You are probably already using them, which means setting them up is easy
